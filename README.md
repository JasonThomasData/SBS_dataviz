These projects are some of the best dataviz that I produced as a data journalist at SBS News. These were made using d3.js and leaflet.js, predominantly.

There are many more dataviz and stories that aren't here.

####age_distribution_explainer

Published in January 2016 on [SBS News](http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/01/12/interactive-what-will-australias-population-look-2050).

This was a story and dataviz to give some perspective to what it means to have an ageing population, and what the solution might look like.

This shows recorded and projected estimated resident population since 1971.

####preferential_voting_explainer

Published before the federal election in 2016 on [SBS News](http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/05/19/interactive-how-does-preferential-voting-work-australia)

This was produced to inform people about how the voting system works in Australia, which is particularly important since so many talk about preference deals in the house of representatives - totally incorrect, there are no deals.

Of particular interest to me was getting this project in front of people who do not use English as their first language. We produced the same dataviz for Arabic, Spanish, Vietnamese and other language programs at SBS.

####vic_fire_map

Published after the Wye River Bushfires in Victoria on [SBS News](http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/02/15/wye-river-bushfire-maps-see-rapid-fire-devastation)

This was produced to draw attention to how quickly a bushfire can spread. It's a clever combination of a map and a timeline to show how the size and magnitude of a disaster changed across time and area.

Getting this data was difficult, but most interesting data is difficult to get.

####earthquakeLiveFeedMap

This map is a production-ready element to be re-published on the SBS News site when it's needed. 

When there's an earthquake the user can press ```shft i``` to print a url with a query string to the console. That query string will contain details about the map centre and zoom level of the map when printing to console happened.

The map receives a live feed of data from the USGS. All that needs to happen for the user is to embed the map in the SBS News website.
